I am trying to make this as simple as possible. The first thing you have to make sure is don't skip any part and read everything before you enter any command.
lets get started
First step is login through root user
(Make sure you are connected to internet)
the next step is to install "epel"
yum install epel-release.noarch
yum update epel-release.noarch
yum install bash*
yum install vim
yum install nano (if you prefer nano editor)
yum install net-tools
yum group list (check the groups select if you want GNOME or any other)
i am selecting MATE Desktop
yum groups install "MATE Desktop"
